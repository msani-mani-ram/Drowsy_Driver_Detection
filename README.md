# Drowsy Driver Detection System ðŸ˜´ðŸš—

This project is a real-time drowsiness detection system designed to prevent accidents caused by sleepy drivers. The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect whether a driver's eyes are open or closed, triggering an alarm if the eyes remain closed for a certain period.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Real-time face and eye detection using OpenCV and Haar Cascades.
- Deep learning-based eye state classification using a custom CNN.
- Alarm activation when the driver shows signs of drowsiness.
- Visual feedback through live webcam feed with status and score overlay.
